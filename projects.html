                <h2>Project 1: Requirement Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                    Our group was tasked with building a student administration website for a client in our requirement analysis class. Our objective was to compile all the essential specifications and produce a thorough plan for developing the website in accordance with the client's requirements.
                    Throughout the project, we maintained regular communication with the client, sharing our progress and gathering feedback.</p>
                <p>
                    We used tools like Trello , StarUML and Axure to keep track of our tasks and make sure that everyone was on the same page. We created a plan for building the website, including a detailed project timeline, a breakdown of tasks, and a list of deliverables.I was in charge of "managing the timeslots" part of the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, this project allowed us to apply the knowledge we gained in our requirement analysis class to a real-world scenario. It also gave us the opportunity to work collaboratively as a team and learn how to effectively communicate with a client to gather requirements and build a website that met their needs.

                <h2>Project 2: Budget Manager Desktop Application</h2>
                <p>In this project for my DevOps and Security course, I built a Budget Manager desktop application using C# and XAML. The project's goal was to gain knowledge about how to deploy and secure the application in a production environment using DevOps and security principles.</p>
                <p>
                    I started by utilizing XAML to create the application's user interface with the intention of developing a simple and user-friendly interface for managing personal finances. I then wrote the application code using C# implementing features such as the ability to add delete and update income and expenses.</p>
                <p>
                    Next, I used GitHub Action to create a CI/CD pipeline that automatically built, tested, and deployed the application to a target environment. This made it possible for me to guarantee that the application was constantly updated and operating as intended.</p>
                <p>Technologies used: C#, XAML, GitHub Actions</p>
